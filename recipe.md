 Grease the bottom and sides of a 7-inch round baking pan with butter.

 Evenly spread sugar at the bottom of the pan.

 Place one of the pineapple rings in the middle and nine half-circles around the edges.

 Add Maraschino cherries to the center circle and the half rings . Preheat oven at 350 degrees F. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.  Set aside.

 Combine sugar, pineapple essence, and oil in a large mixing bowl. 
 Beat sugar and oil until smooth. 

Spoon in the flour mixture, with milk, beating on low speed until well combined.

 Pineapple upside-down cake batter should be of a thick spoon drop consistency. Meaning the batter should drop off the spoon easily.

 Scrape down the sides of the bowl and gently fold in the cake batter. 

 Pour the cake batter over the arranged pineapple slices. 

Even out the batter with a spoon. Bake the cake in a preheated oven for an hour or until the toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean with a few crumbs attached. 

 Remove the cake from the oven and set it over the counter to cool. Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 40 to 50 minutes. Run a knife around the edges of the cake to remove the band.

Carefully invert the cake onto a serving platter. Wait for another 40-50 minutes, then run a knife around the bottom plate to make sure it is not stuck at the corners.

Carefully lift off the bottom tray. Serve warm.
